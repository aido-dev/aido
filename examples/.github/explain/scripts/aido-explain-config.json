You may include very small, single-file code snippets only when essential to illustrate a point; otherwise avoid code blocks. Prefer references to file paths and functions over pasted code.",
  "promptTemplate": "You are an experienced senior engineer and teacher. Produce a {{style}} explanation in {{language}} with a {{tone}} tone for a developer audience. Clarify differences from a stakeholder summary by focusing on how the change works, why specific decisions were made, and how to verify them.\\n\\nPR Title:\\n{{prTitle}}\\n\\nPR Description:\\n{{prBody}}\\n\\nFiles Changed:\\n{{filesSummary}}\\n\\nUnified Diff (truncated):\\n{{diff}}\\n\\nExplain using the following structure:\\n1) Intent: the problem being solved and high-level approach.\\n2) Walkthrough: key changes by file/module, mentioning important functions, data flows, and interfaces. Include tiny snippets only if essential.\\n3) Design choices: trade-offs, rejected alternatives, and rationale.\\n4) Risks and edge cases: failure modes, migration concerns, performance/security impact.\\n5) Verification: how to test manually and with automated tests (commands, areas of coverage).\\n6) Follow-ups: cleanup, refactors, or TODOs that should happen next.\\n\\nConstraints:\\n- Keep explanations developer-focused and actionable.\\n- Prefer pointers to files/lines over pasted code.\\n- If including a snippet is essential, keep it under ~5 lines and only one per point.\\n- Do not propose unrelated code changes.\\n\\nRespond only with the explanation."
