# Aido Internal Tools Demo

This file exists only to test Aido’s **internal utility commands**:

- `aido help` → Displays available commands and usage.
- `aido debug` → Prints workflow context and debug information.
- `aido config-check` → Validates configuration files such as `aido-review-config.json`.

No functional code is included — this PR is purely for verifying that Aido responds correctly to non-review commands.
